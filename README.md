# 2DSCI
A study to analyze the factors affecting the transition to Data Science. ðŸ“‹

# The Proposal

The primary hypothesis that we will try to test is whether a person with a background in computing finds it just as easy to transition into data science as a person with background in statistics. For this we have described our survey design and the specific questions we intend to ask in this [proposal](https://github.ubc.ca/ubc-mds-2017/2DSCI/blob/master/proposal.md).
