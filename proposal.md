## Project Proposal

## Our Question: 

For this project we are interested in identifying factors that may influence the ease in which a person  transitions into Data Science. More specifically, does having a background in Statistics, Programming, Both or None have an effect on perceived ease of transition. Our hypothesis is that all four groups will have the same perceived ease of transition.

(*note we do not believe this will be the outcome, but, it serves as our testable null hypothesis) 

<br/>

## Survey Design: 

The following are questions which we have decided are necessary to include in our survey. They have been annotated to denote their purpose. We are still in the process of addressing specific word choices and the order of the questions as they appear here is arbitrary. 

<br/> 
<br/>


**Question 1:** To categorize survey respondents based on their prior experiences. This will be our categorical X variable.


Q: Prior to your introduction to Data Science, which of these statements best describes your background:

 * I had experience with statistics.
 * I had experience with programming.
 * I had experience with both programming and statistics.
 * I had no more than entry level knowledge of either topic.

<br/> 

**Question 2:** To assess our hypothesis directly. This will be our Y variable. 

Q. How would you describe your transition into data science:

* Easy
* Somewhat easy
* Medium
* Somewhat hard
* Hard

<br/>

**Question 3:** To assess the confounding effects of how recently the respondent has graduated from University. 

Q: How recently have you graduated from your last degree:

 * This year
 * 1-3
 * 3-5
 * +5

 <br/>
 
**Question 4:** To assess the confounding effects of having worked in a professional environment previously.
 
Q: Have you had any experience in professional work environment (not a co-op or internship) prior to your introduction to Data Science?

* Yes
* No

<br/>

**Question 5:**  To assess the confounding effects of skills leaned from doing an additional graduate degree.

Q: Did you have another graduate degree prior to your introduction to Data Science:

* Yes 
* No

## Analysis Ideas 

As our X variable is categorical and we are working with more than 4 groups we have been debating between our choices of ANOVA and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

In the event that our Y is continuous, we will be using an ANOVA to do the analysis on our hypothesis. 

In the event that our Y is discrete, we will be using a Generalized Linear Model. 
 
We are still in the stages of deciding which is best to assess our question. However, either will be fairly easy to implement and will not change the outline of the questions shared above. We will be comparing the 4 groups on their perceived ease of transition to Data Science.
