## Project Proposal

## Our Question: 

For this project we are interested in identifying factors that may influence the ease in which a person  transitions into Data Science. More specifically, does having a background in Statistics, Programming, Both or None have an effect on perceived ease of transition. Our hypothesis is that all four groups will have the same perceived ease of transition.

(*note we do not believe this will be the outcome, but, it serves as our testable null hypothesis) 

<br/>

## Survey Design: 

The following are questions which we have decided are necessary to include in our survey. They have been annotated to denote their purpose. We are still in the process of addressing specific word choices and the order of the questions as they appear here is arbitrary. 

<br/> 
<br/>


**Question 1:** To categorize survey respondents based on their prior experiences. This will be our categorical X variable.


Q: Prior to your introduction to Data Science, which of these statements best describes your background:

 * I had experience with statistics.
 * I had experience with programming.
 * I had experience with both programming and statistics.
 * I had no more than entry level knowledge of either topic.

<br/> 

**Question 2:** To assess our hypothesis directly. This will be our Y variable. 

Q. How would you describe your transition into data science:

* Easy
* Somewhat easy
* Medium
* Somewhat hard
* Hard

<br/>

**Question 3:** To assess the confounding effects of how recently the respondent has graduated from University. 

Q: How recently have you graduated from your last degree:

 * This year
 * 1-3
 * 3-5
 * +5


**Explanation:** We believe that if the respondent has been out of school for less than a year then he or she may find the transition to data sciece relatively easy. This will directly affect our dependent or `Y` variable and so we want to test the effect of this confounding variable on our hypothesis.

 <br/>
 
**Question 4:** To assess the confounding effects of having worked in a professional environment previously.
 
Q: Have you had any experience in professional work environment (not a co-op or internship) prior to your introduction to Data Science?

* Yes
* No

**Explanation:** We believe that if the respondent has worked in a professional work environment full-time previously then he or she may find it realtively easy to transition into data science as compared to those who haven't had any experience in a professional work environment. We believe this will be the case because the MDS is a professional masters program aimed at helping its students to gain relevant experience to transition into a professional work environment with a focus on Data Science. We want to assess its effect as a confounding variable on the response or the `Y` variable.

<br/>

**Question 5:**  To assess the confounding effects of skills leaned from doing an additional graduate degree.

Q: Did you have another graduate degree prior to your introduction to Data Science:

* Yes 
* No

**Explanation:** We believe that respondents with other graduate degrees before their introduction to data science will find it easier ti transition into a graduate degree in Data Science due to prior experience in a similar program. They would know what is expected of them in such a fast-forward professional masters program and would find the workload easier to manage. We want to assess the effect quantitatively through this study.

## Analysis Ideas 

As our X variable is categorical and we are working with more than 4 groups we have been debating between our choices of ANOVA and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

In the event that our Y is continuous, we will be using an ANOVA to do the analysis on our hypothesis. 

In the event that our Y is discrete, we will be using a Generalized Linear Model. 
 
We are still in the stages of deciding which is best to assess our question. However, either will be fairly easy to implement and will not change the outline of the questions shared above. We will be comparing the 4 groups on their perceived ease of transition to Data Science. 

## Ethics

The aspects of UBC office of Research Ethics document on using Online Surveys that are relevant to our survey are:

Under FIPPA(BC Freedom of Information and protection of Privacy Act.) "personal information" which is defined as "recorded information about an identifiable individual" must be stored inside the jurisdiction of Canada. In our survey we have asked questions which are not key identifiers, however the last 3 questions in combination can be identified as quasi-identifiers. We plan on seeeking the consent of the individuals being surveyed before uploading this information on online portals.
